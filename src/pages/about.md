I am a Software Engineer and Open Source Enthusiast currently based in West Des Moines, Iowa. During the day I am a Software Engineering Consultant at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sourceallies.com/">Source Allies</a> and during the night and on the weekends I am a core maintainer and developer on the <a target="_blank" href="https://hospitalrun.io">HospitalRun</a> project. Formerly, I was a Programmer Analyst at Telligen.

I graduated from Iowa State University with a degree in Software Engineering in May of 2018. During my time at Iowa State I was a Peer Mentor for the Software Engineering Learning Community, President of the Computer Science and Software Engineering Club, and Chair of the Software Engineering Student Advisory Committee. I also was part of creating a pretty cool project <a target="_blank" href="https://hammer-io.github.io">hammer.io</a>.
